# Chat Rooms

This projects main purpose is for me to increase my understanding of Golang and a frontend technology I have not yet decided on (probably either htmx or vue)

## Features

### Lobby
- users can enter a username
- users can create or join chatrooms by entering a name for the room
- users can see a list of existing rooms with their current number of users online and join these
- the chatroom list is updated regularly, but not necessarily in realtime

### Chatroom
- users get all messages as soon as they are sent (within a reasonable timeframe?)
- users don't get messages from before joining
- every message shows its user and the time the message was sent
- users can send their own messages (obviously) 
- on lost connection, the client tries to automatically reconnect
- the user can leave the chatroom and return to the lobby

### Potential Additional Features for Practice
- chat formatting: allow users to add styling (bold, italic) to the messages
- provide a simple emote selection
- play a notification sound if the chat window is not focused and add the functionality to turn this off
- scroll back: allow users to scroll back and view older messages from before joining
